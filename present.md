  <h4>So how to do it?</h4>

# monPlan Git Workflow
<center>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/c5L8RFE.png" width="10000%"/>
</center>

- **master**: branch is the key branch, everytime for release
- **develop**: _unstable_, most of the PRs should go here
- **'feature/*'**, **'fix/***, etc.: are 'for purpose' branches, these branches are for development
- **deploy** (not shown), is for **manual** deployments to prod

---

# Branch Permissions
* **no-one** has write permissions to _master_, _develop_ or _deploy_, not even DevOps or Admin.
* **everyone** has PR write access, only when
	- 1 Tests Pass
	- 1 Approval from a Code-review 
* that way, we 'silly'-proof our codebase.

---

## Setting Branch Permissions

Branch permissions by people who have _administrator_ privellages inside a repo.

To set this, Go to Settings and under workflow select Branch Permissions.

## Demo of Branch Permissions

<span style="font-size: 15px">Note that we will be using <b>NodeJS</b> for the sake of this demo/talk, but the idea is similar</span>

<center><h1>First, It's the Development Team's Problem to write <u>appropriate</u> Tests, not the CI/CDs role</h1><h1>Second, the CI works on an alternative CLI, so running tests on interactive mode <u>won't work</u></h1></center>

# Setting up CI for Testing

_default Pipeline runs for all branches (if not matched)_

_from bitbucket-pipelines.yml_
```yaml
image: node:8

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        caches:
          - node
        script: 
          - yarn # <- Install Dependencies
          - yarn test:ci # <- Test in Non-CI Mode
```
